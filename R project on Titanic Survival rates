Using ggplot2, create appropriate plots to answer the following questions:

#relationship between survival and gender?

#to add Titles to the strips
S.labs <- c('0' = "Died", '1' = "Survied")

#Plotting the bar graph using ggplot
#Dropped the NA values
#Used coord_flip for better comparison and Visualization 
titanic_new %>% drop_na(Gender,Survived) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Gender, fill = factor(Survived, labels = c("Died", "Survied")))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(title = "Survival rate with respect to Gender",   caption = "Data Source: titanic.csv", x = "Gender", y = "No. of people
       on Titanic", fill = "Survival Status") +
  coord_flip() + 
  facet_wrap(Survived ~.,labeller = as_labeller(S.labs)) +
  theme_bw() +  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold",color = "Brown"))

#Observation: from the graph we can see that the death rate is way to high in Male when compared to Female, and the Survival rate is high in Female than Male.
#So, we could conclude that there is a relationship between survival and gender.

```

#relationship between survival and class?
```{r}

#to add Titles to the strips
S.labs <- c('0' = "Died", '1' = "Survied")

#Plotting the bar graph using ggplot
#Used coord_flip for better comparison and Visualization 
titanic %>% ggplot(aes(x = PClass, fill = factor(Survived, labels = c("Died", "Survied")))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(y = "No. of people on Titanic", fill = "Survival Status", x = "Class levels", title = "Survival rate with respect to Titanic Classes", caption = "Data Source: titanic.csv" ) +
  facet_wrap(Survived ~.,labeller = as_labeller(S.labs)) +
  theme_bw() +  
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold",color = "Brown"))

#Observation:The death rate is trending downwards through the lower class to higher class, where as in the survival case, the first class high rate when compared with others. We could clearly say that there is a relationship between death cases with respect to class.  

```

# Is there a relationship between survival and marital status for females? What about males? If there isn't enough data to answer a question, state so and explain.
```{r}

#Plotting the bar graph using ggplot
#Dropped the NA values
#Removed facet_wrap for better comparison
#Using titanic_new directly as Male marital status is NA
titanic_new %>% drop_na(Marital_status,Survived) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Marital_status, fill = factor(Survived, labels = c("Died", "Survied")))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(title = "Survival rate with respect to Female Marital status",   caption = "Data Source: titanic.csv", x = "Marital status in Female", y = "No. of people", fill = "Survival Status") +
  theme_bw() +  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold",color = "Brown"))

#Observation1: Survival rate is not dependent on the marital status as we could see same count for married and unmarried women where as unmarried women died more than the married women.

#Observation2: In case of Males, through the titles we could not segregate the Marital status as any man whose age is above 18 years is just refered as Mr. So, no enough information to deduce the relationship.
