## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r
Naming the four suits by making Suits.
suits <- c('spades', 'clubs', 'diamonds', 'hearts')
#faces by listing out all 13.
faces <- c('king', 'queen', 'jack', 'ten', 'nine', 'eight', 'seven', 'six', 'five', 'four', 'three', 'two', 'ace')
#Faces can be duplicated by listing all 13 of them.
face <- rep(faces, 4)
#Card values are determined by listing the values and then duplicating that number four times.
value <- rep(13:1, 4)
#Combining the three lists to create the decl using data.frame
deck <- data.frame(faces, suits, value)
#to Know top part of the deck table
head(deck)
#to Know Bottom(tail) part of the deck table
tail(deck)
#to Know Dimention of the deck table
dim(deck)
#to Know type of the deck table
typeof(deck)
@#Return the value of deck in the first row and column.
deck[1,1]
deck[1,1:3]
#selection using logical values
deck[5,c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)]
deck[5, c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)]
#deal function created to deal out random cards (rows) from the deck without replacing those cards in the deck during the random sample procedure
deal <- function(cards) { 
  cards[1,]
}
#In order to shuffle the cards in the deck created the shuffle function and choose the values.
shuffle <- function(cards) {
  random <- sample(1:52, 52)
  cards[random,]
}
 the shuffle function
shuffle(deck)
#retrieving suit column values
deck$suits
deck$faces
#retrieving Value column values
deck$value
#moving to other object
deck2<-deck
#Creating new column with values
deck2$new <- 1:52
head(deck2)
#using Spades instead of Spades
deck2$suit[deck2$suit == "spades"] <- "Spades"
#to extract the "diamonds" set from the deck
deck2[deck2$suit == "diamonds", ]
#Queens from all sets are being assembled.
deck2[deck2$face == "queen", ]
#Only queens from clubs and gems are being gathered.
deck2[(deck2$face == "queen" & deck2$suit == "clubs") | (deck2$face == "queen" & deck2$suit == "diamonds"), ]
deck2


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
